Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using a dataset of choice to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights. The analysis is performed with popular Python libraries such as pandas,numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Objectives:
- Data Exploration: Understand the datasetâ€™s characteristics, including data types, missing values, and summary statistics.
- Data Visualization: Use histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
- Insight Generation: Analyze relationships within the data to gain insights that could drive further data processing or predictive modeling.

Key Steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
2. Data Visualization:
   - Histograms: For understanding data distribution.
   - Scatter Plots: To explore relationships between variables.
   - Heatmaps: For analyzing correlations among features.
3. Interpretation: Draw insights from visualizations to support data-driven decisions or model-building.

This project provides an introductory yet comprehensive example of EDA techniques commonly used in data science.
